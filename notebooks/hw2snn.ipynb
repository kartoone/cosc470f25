    "# HW 2 - Simple Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1: In this first real coding assignment, you will initially explore the operation of a single perceptron (more for historical value than for modern usefulness) and a single Sigmoid neuron to implement the \"real world\" example of going to a cheese festival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: In the second part, you will switch over to using the author's code to complete a full neural network that can recognize handwritten digits. You will train and run the network monitoring both how long it takes to train AND the test accuracy once training is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3: In the third part, you will experiment with hyper-parameters such as the number of epochs, the batch size, and the learning rate. Again, you will monitor the training time and the test accuracy after training is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 4: In the final part, you will experiment with the network structure itself by changing the number of neurons in the hidden layer. You will again report the training time and test accuracy, but this time you will also report the evaluation time.\n"
